## 0. Executive TL;DR
Unified Smart Home platform consolidating fragmented IoT ecosystems into one secure, transparent control surface: devices + predictable automation + conversational AI + low‚Äëlatency camera streaming, all under a deny‚Äëby‚Äëdefault authorization model.


## 1. Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Outcome
**Problem (Fragmentation):** Users juggle multiple vendor apps (Fibaro, Home Assistant, raw camera URLs) with duplicated device concepts and opaque automation failures.
**Problem (Lack of Transparency):** Traditional rule engines give little insight into why a rule did or did not fire; debugging becomes guesswork.
**Problem (Cognitive Overhead):** Turning intent ("Dim the hallway lights at sunset unless motion") into precise multi‚Äësystem actions requires expert knowledge.

**Solution:** A unified orchestration and automation platform:
- Single device & scene abstraction (Adapter + Orchestrator) spanning providers.
- Minute‚Äëaligned automation loop with pluggable triggers & actions.
- Conversational AI layer translating natural language into structured, auditable intents.
- Managed FFmpeg pipeline producing short‚Äësegment HLS for near real‚Äëtime camera viewing.
- Deny‚Äëby‚Äëdefault Resource/Action authorization to prevent accidental exposure.
- Rich observability: execution history + system timeline + provenance for AI answers.

**Outcome:** Faster rule iteration, reduced cognitive load, explainable automations, consistent UX, improved security posture, and a foundation for AI‚Äëassisted expansion (suggested rules, anomaly insights).

## 2. Core Pillars
| Pillar | User / Business Value | Key Mechanism |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Devices Unification | One mental model across vendors | Adapter + Orchestrator abstraction |
| Automation Engine | Consistent & explainable outcomes | Minute‚Äëaligned scheduler + trigger evaluators + action executors |
| AI Layer | Natural language ‚Üí structured action | Embeddings + intent normalization + provenance surfacing |
| Security | Prevents accidental exposure | Deny‚Äëby‚Äëdefault Resource/Action authorization middleware |
| Streaming | Low friction situational awareness | Managed FFmpeg ‚Üí short (2s) HLS segments + cleanup |
| Observability | Faster debugging & trust | Timeline + execution history + structured logs |
| Extensibility | Sustainable feature growth | Plug‚Äëin triggers, actions, integrations (DI multi‚Äëregistration) |

## 3. Architecture Overview
**Frontend (Angular SSR + Tailwind):** Standalone feature domains (`devices`, `cameras`, `rules`, `integrations`, `ai`, `auth`). Reusable UI primitives keep styling consistent; interceptors centralize base URL, auth, XSRF.

**Backend (.NET 10):** Modular service composition; controllers thin ‚Üí orchestrators / services; deterministic background worker (automation); AI chat & embedding layer; FFmpeg streaming manager.

**Security:** Explicit Resource/Action attributes enforced centrally; JWT + future MFA (TOTP implemented, WebAuthn planned). Rate limiting for AI endpoints.

**Observability:** Structured logs (Serilog), execution history & system timeline for correlation; provenance surfaced in AI responses.

**Performance Considerations:** Short HLS segments (2s) for latency; `-codec copy` to avoid unnecessary transcode; minute boundary alignment reduces scheduling drift.

**Extensibility:** New trigger/action/integration added via DI registration‚Äîno core refactor required.

## 5. Feature Matrix (Excerpt)
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Unified Device Catalog | ‚úÖ | Fibaro + Home Assistant abstraction (Tuya ready) |
| Rule Automation Engine | ‚úÖ | Deterministic minute cycle + debounce |
| Conversational AI | ‚úÖ | Intent normalization + provenance chunks |
| Camera Streaming | ‚úÖ | Managed FFmpeg ‚Üí 2s HLS segments |
| Deny-by-Default AuthZ | ‚úÖ | Missing metadata ‚áí 403 enforced centrally |
| TOTP MFA Foundation | ‚úÖ | Encrypted secrets, lockout strategy |
| WebAuthn | üîú | Planned (frontend scaffolding) |
| AI Rule Suggestions | üîú | Planned (embedding + pattern mining) |
| Energy Analytics | üîú | Planned (time‚Äëseries & widgets) |

## 6. AI & Automation Flow
The AI layer turns conversational intent into orchestrated actions while preserving traceability:
1. Embed curated docs & capability descriptors (offline build step) ‚Üí semantic index.
2. User prompt ‚Üí semantic retrieval (top relevant chunks) ‚Üí context assembly.
3. Intent normalization boundary converts free text into structured command (type + parameters + optional safety checks).
4. If actionable ‚Üí orchestrator executes device/scene/rule test; else returns informational answer.
5. Provenance (used chunks + executed actions) returned to UI for trust & audit.

Sequence reference: [`diagrams/sequence-ai-command.md`](./diagrams/sequence-ai-command.md)

Automation engine complements AI by executing scheduled / event-driven rules:
- Minute‚Äëaligned loop reduces temporal drift and simplifies reasoning.
- Trigger evaluators isolate rule activation logic (time windows / event checks / future device state observers).
- Action executors perform idempotent operations against unified device abstraction.
- Execution history persists outcome (timestamp, success/failure, metadata) for debugging and analytics.

Sequence reference: [`diagrams/sequence-automation.md`](./diagrams/sequence-automation.md)

Future focus: AI‚Äëassisted rule template suggestions; counterfactual ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt this run?‚Äù diagnostics.

## 7. Security & Privacy
Security is foundational‚Äînot retrofitted:
| Aspect | Approach | Value |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Authorization | Deny‚Äëby‚Äëdefault Resource/Action attributes + middleware | Eliminates accidental open endpoints |
| Authentication | JWT (short‚Äëlived) + refresh + MFA readiness (TOTP encrypted) | Layered defense |
| MFA Secret Protection | AES‚ÄëGCM versioned envelope | Integrity + future rotation |
| Rate Limiting (AI) | Catch & signal with Retry‚ÄëAfter header | Predictable client backoff |
| Secret Handling | Env variables for model keys / integration credentials | Avoids repo leakage |
| Defense in Depth | Central logging of deny reasons | Faster audit & forensics |
| Least Privilege | Granular Resource/Action taxonomy | Minimal surface exposure |

Snippet (auth middleware) planned: [`code-snippets/security/`](./code-snippets/security/)

Future items:
- WebAuthn second factor.
- Endpoint-level anomaly detection (excessive failed rule modifications).
- Optional signed HLS playlist URLs.

## 8. Streaming Pipeline (Low-Latency HLS)
Goals: near real‚Äëtime camera visibility, stable resource usage, safe restarts.
- RTSP input ‚Üí FFmpeg managed process ‚Üí 2s HLS segments (ring buffer of ~10s window).
- Deletion flags (`delete_segments+append_list`) keep storage minimal.
- `-codec copy` avoids heavy CPU; audio stripped (`-an`) when not needed to reduce bandwidth.
- Wrapper waits for playlist readiness (ensures UI does not 404 initial load).
- Health: if no playlist update within threshold ‚Üí restart routine (planned snippet).

Advantages:
- Lower latency vs traditional 6‚Äì8s segments.
- Stable memory/disk footprint via aggressive cleanup.
- Clear isolation: Streaming Service boundary keeps FFmpeg specifics from polluting higher layers.

Planned snippets: [`code-snippets/streaming/`](./code-snippets/streaming/)

Future focus: adaptive segment length, optional per‚Äëcamera key rotation, exploratory WebRTC path.

## 9. Observability & Explainability
| Dimension | Mechanism | Benefit |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Automation Transparency | Execution history (rule id, timestamp, action results) | Rapid root cause analysis |
| System Timeline | Unified event ledger (device state, rule fire, integration updates) | Correlated narrative of system behavior |
| AI Provenance | Returned chunk metadata + executed action list | Trust & audit of AI outputs |
| Structured Logging | Enriched context (ruleId, triggerType, duration) | Filterable diagnostics & metrics export |
| Authorization Denials | Reason codes (MissingMetadata / Denied) | Fast permission gap detection |
| Streaming Health | Playlist readiness & update timestamps | Early anomaly detection |

Future instrumentation:
- Latency histogram for rule evaluation vs execution.
- Per integration error budget (e.g., Fibaro API failure rate).
- OpenTelemetry traces (Controller ‚Üí Orchestrator ‚Üí Adapter).
