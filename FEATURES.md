## 2. Automation Engine Detail
- Trigger Evaluators: time-based (daily). (Planned: sensor, sunrise/sunset)
- Action Executors: Fibaro device/scene actions (extensible interface).
- Debounce Strategy: per rule minute-slot stamp preventing double execution.
- Persistence: execution log with outcome + message fields for diagnostics.

## 3. Security & Hardening Highlights
| Aspect | Mechanism | Value |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Authorization | Deny-by-default middleware | Minimizes accidental exposure |
| Permissions | Resource/Action attributes | Generates clear permission matrix |
| Secrets | AES-GCM encryption for TOTP | Integrity + confidentiality |
| Rate Limiting | Retry-After header for AI | Client aware backoff guidance |
| Logging Hygiene | Credential masking | Reduces leak risk in diagnostics |

## 4. AI Orchestration
Flow: Prompt â†’ Embed context â†’ Intent resolution â†’ (Optional) Action execution â†’ Answer + provenance.
Provides transparent usedChunks listing to explain why an answer was formed.

## 5. Extensibility Surfaces
| Surface | Add Steps | Effort |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| New Action Type | Implement IAutomationActionExecutor + DI register | Low |
| New Trigger Type | Implement IAutomationTriggerEvaluator + register | Low |
| New Integration | Adapter service + models + UI panel | Medium |
| New AI Provider | Swap model/env vars in HarmonyAI.SDK config | Low |
| New Streaming Param | Adjust FFmpeg args constants | Low |

## 6. Portfolio Talking Points
- Explicit extensibility seams reduce future feature cost.
- Deterministic scheduling improves trust and debuggability.
- Security posture intentionally strict (opt-in endpoints only).
- AI integrated as orchestrator, not generic chat widget.
- Observability first: timeline + execution context logging.

## 7. Suggested Live Demo Script
1. Show dashboard + unified devices.
2. Open AI chat: issue natural command triggering a scene.
3. Create a rule; wait for scheduled execution; inspect history.
4. Start a camera stream; refresh to show low-latency segments.
5. Highlight denial behavior by hitting an endpoint w/out metadata (403 conceptually).
