# Security Snippets

Security-first code examples demonstrating defense-in-depth principles:

- **deny-by-default-authorization.cs** - Central middleware preventing accidental endpoint exposure
- **totp-encryption-service.cs** - AES-GCM encrypted TOTP secret storage with versioning  
- **rate-limiter.cs** - Sliding window rate limiting for sensitive operations

Each snippet: context (problem → solution → value) + production-ready code + engineering rationale.
